# Detecting Emotion With Azure Cognitive Services

Azure is a cloud computing platform from Microsoft. It offers solutions for compute, Internet of things, and machine learning. This lab will take you through using a trained machine learning model for detecting faces in an image and their emotion.  

You will produce a program that can take in a link to any image and display an image with the emotion of the detected faces overlaid on the image.
